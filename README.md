<h2><strong>About the Repository</strong></h2>
Todo is a browser based application for managing todo list ( A list of what users want to do ) .
The user can create an account , login into to the dashboard , add items , manage items  , and also customise profile .
I used client side storage for the application ; everything is stored to localStorage.
As a way to enforce authorization , I use cookies/session to check users trying to access dashboard.html without visiting login.
